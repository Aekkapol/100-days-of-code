# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 21, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos "Welcome to the course"

**Thoughts:** In my opinion I think this course gives the right amount of contents to finish each day. 


### Day 1: November 22, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through videos on the datetime module. How to import datetime, date, and timedelta. how to assign date and time delta. How to use math operation between datetime and timedelta.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally type the codes and get the results.

**Sample codes**
from datetime import datetime
from datetime import date
from datetime import timedelta
>>> todaydate = date.today()
>>> sleephour = timedelta(hours=6)
>>> todaydate + sleephour
datetime.date(2018, 11, 22)
>>> todaytime = datetime.today()
>>> todaytime + sleephour
datetime.datetime(2018, 11, 23, 4, 46, 18, 650656)
>>> str(todaytime + sleephour)
'2018-11-23 04:46:18.650656'
>>> christmas = date(2018,12,25)
>>> christmas
datetime.date(2018, 12, 25)
>>> str(christmas)
'2018-12-25'
>>> todaydate - christmas
datetime.timedelta(-33)
>>> christmas - todaydate
datetime.timedelta(33)
>>> (christmas - todaydate).days
33
>>> str((christmas - todaydate).days)
'33'

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
