ent# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 21, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos "Welcome to the course"

**Thoughts:** In my opinion I think this course gives the right amount of contents to finish each day. 


### Day 1: November 22, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through videos on the datetime module. How to import datetime, date, and timedelta. how to assign date and time delta. How to use math operation between datetime and timedelta.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally type the codes and get the results.

**Sample codes**
See in AJ_100_days_of_code

None


### Day 2: November 23, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced datetime module even more. I tried using the regular expression to extract the number from the texts.

**Thoughts** Spent 5 hours to finish this bite. Too long I guess, but really a good start. When I looked at the solution code, it is written so great.

### Day 3: November 24, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I created a very simplest Pomodoro timer using datetime, timedelta, while loop to stop the time when it turns True.

**Thoughts** This make-from-scratch lesson is very difficult to me. I almost gave up and thought that I should take basic Python and come back later. Anyway, here I am.

### Day 4: November 25, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I watched videos on Collection module. How to use namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter.

**Thoughts** Not much idea how to apply these.

### Day 5: November 26, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced using namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter on the movie data.

**Thoughts** It is a bit rough at the beginning.


### Day 6: November 27, 2018 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished analysing the movie dataset. I could get the table format right as required, using namedtuple, defaultdict, Counter, and f-string on the movie data. But I do not know how to sort the score in values of default dict.  And I was supposed to apply Collection on my own data. But the lesson from Day 6 had already taken the whole two days. So no progress today. But I learned a lot from these 3 days.

**Thoughts** I gotta find the way to sort the specific element in values of default dict.


### Day 7: November 28, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched the videos on lists, dictionary, tuple

**Thoughts** Keep learning. Don't give up AJ.

### Day 8: November 29, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Cracked Bite 21. Query a nested data structure. https://codechalleng.es/bites/21/

**Thoughts** So amazed looking at the solution. They are so short and beautiful.

### Day 9: November 30, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: Cracked Bite 89. Playing with lists and dicts. https://codechalleng.es/bites/89/

**Thoughts** Even though, this exercise is just playing around with us states list and dictm I think I learned quite a lot for example I learned how to return a list of every nth item in a larger list (the modulo % work the same way as well), how to use '+' to concatenate the lists, how to use dict.get(key) to get value from the dictionary, how to use max(iterable, key=function), how to extract the last n element from the list [-10:] and sort them sorted().

### NOT FINISHED Day 10: December 1, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I learned from videos on Testing your code with pytest / D1 (lectures) 

**Thoughts** Now it is getting real difficult. I think I need to skip these three days and come back later (day 10-12).

### NOT FINISHED Day 11: December 2, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**:  

**Thoughts** Will come back to these three days (day 10-12).

### NOT FINISHED Day 12: December 3, 2018 Monday

**Today's Progress**:  

**Thoughts** Will come back to these three days (day 10-12).

### NOT FINISHED Day 13: December 4, 2018 Tuesday (PAPER - SCISSOR - HAMMER)

**Today's Progress**:  I learned videos on Text-based games (and classes) / D1 (lectures)  

**Thoughts** Classes is the first priority I should get my hands on.

### NOT FINISHED Day 14: December 5, 2018 Wednesday (PAPER - SCISSOR - HAMMER)

**Today's Progress**:  I worked on Text-based games (and classes) / D2 (practice)  

**Thoughts** Classes is the first priority I should get my hands on.

### NOT FINISHED Day 15: December 6, 2018 Thursday (PAPER - SCISSOR - HAMMER)

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Text-based games (and classes) / D3 (more coding)  

**Thoughts** Classes is the first priority I should get my hands on.
 
### Day 16: December 7, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I studied List comprehensions and generators / D1 (lectures)  

**Thoughts** Still I do not fully understand how to create generators. Need more practice!


### Day 17: December 8, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I worked on List comprehensions and generators / D2 (practice). I learned min(list, key=len), list.sort(reverse = True), string.title(), how to swap first name and last name using front, back = name.split(), min(strings, key=len), random.sample(list, 2)   

**Thoughts** List and dicts comprehension are awesome.

### Day 18: December 9, 2018 Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I cracked Bite 26. Dictionary comprehensions are awesome https://codechalleng.es/bites/26/   

**Thoughts** Feeling victory after applying knowledge of list comprehension to dict comprehension. Thing to be careful when refer variable inside function, need to really use function parameter.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
