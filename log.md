ent# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: November 21, 2018 Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Watched videos "Welcome to the course"

**Thoughts:** In my opinion I think this course gives the right amount of contents to finish each day. 


### Day 1: November 22, 2018 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through videos on the datetime module. How to import datetime, date, and timedelta. how to assign date and time delta. How to use math operation between datetime and timedelta.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally type the codes and get the results.

### Day 2: November 23, 2018 Friday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced datetime module even more. I tried using the regular expression to extract the number from the texts.

**Thoughts** Spent 5 hours to finish this bite. Too long I guess, but really a good start. When I looked at the solution code, it is written so great.

### Day 3: November 24, 2018 Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I created a very simplest Pomodoro timer using datetime, timedelta, while loop to stop the time when it turns True.

**Thoughts** This make-from-scratch lesson is very difficult to me. I almost gave up and thought that I should take basic Python and come back later. Anyway, here I am.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
